rem set /A var=val --> /A â€“ This switch is used if the value needs to be numeric in nature
rem goto :eof -> exit sub-routine
rem :main is NOT automatically call
rem EXIT /b has the option to set a specific errorlevel, EXIT /b 0 for sucess, EXIT /b 1 (or greater) for an error. this option will exit only the script (or subroutine) but not CMD.EXE
rem EXIT without an ExitCode acts the same as goto:eof and will not alter the ERRORLEVEL
